"""Pololu driver module for motor controllers using pyserial

This module handles the lower level logic of writing to a pololu motor
controller using python.

Example:
    Here is an example of usage. The first Daisy object sets the port and
    all the of the rest use the same port.
        motor0 = Daisy(0, port="/dev/ttyUSB0")  # only first one has to be set
        motor1 = Daisy(1)  # all following will use the first port
        motor2 = Daisy(2)

        motor1.forward(1600)  # drive forward the motor with device number 1

        # All motors are using port "/dev/ttyUSB0" to send commands
        # Each device is addressed by their device number
